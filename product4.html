      <h3>Pose-1</h3>
      <p>"Create a hyper-realistic portrait photo of me. I am wearing a white textured sweater with cutout designs, standing outdoors in front of a blurred light-blue wall background. My hairstyle is voluminous, wavy, and slightly messy, with a full well-groomed beard. I am smiling naturally while covering part of my mouth with one hand, creating a candid moment. The lighting is soft and natural daylight. The photo should look like a professional portrait shot."</p>
